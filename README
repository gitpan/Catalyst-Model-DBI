NAME
    Catalyst::Model::DBI - DBI Model Class

SYNOPSIS
      # use the helper to create a model for example
      perl script/myapp_create.pl model MyModel DBI dsn username password

      # lib/MyApp/Model/DBI.pm
      package MyApp::Model::DBI;

      use base 'Catalyst::Model::DBI';

      __PACKAGE__->config(
        dsn           => 'DBI:Pg:dbname=mydb;host=localhost',
        username      => 'pgsql',
        password      => '',
        options       => { AutoCommit => 1 },
      );

      1;

      # or load settings from a config file via Config::General for example
      # in your myapp.conf you could have

      name MyApp

      <Model::MyModel>
        dsn "DBI:Pg:dbname=mydb;host=localhost"
        username pgsql
        password ""
        <options>
          AutoCommit 1
        </options>
      </Model>

      # note that config settings always override Model settings

      # do something with $dbh inside a controller ...
      my $dbh = $c->model('MyModel')->dbh;

      # do something with $dbh inside a model ...
      my $dbh = $self->dbh;

      #do something with DBIx::Connector connection inside a controller ...
      my $connection = $c->model('MyModel')->connection;

      #do something with DBIx::Connector connection inside a model ...
      my $connection = $self->connection;

DESCRIPTION
    This is the "DBI" model class. It has been rewritten to use
    DBIx::Connector since it's internal code that deals with connection
    maintenance has already been ported into there. You now have two options
    for doing custom models with Catalyst. Either by using this model and
    any related modules as needed or by having your custom model decoupled
    from Catalyst and glued on using Catalyst::Model::Adaptor

    Some general rules are as follows. If you do not wish to use
    DBIx::Connector directly or DBI and setup connections in your custom
    models or have glue models, then use this model. If you however need
    models that can be re-used outside of your application or simply wish to
    maintain connection code yourself outside of the Catalyst, then use
    Catalyst::Model::Adaptor which allows you to glue outside models into
    your Catalyst app.

METHODS
    new Initializes DBI connection

    $self->connection
        Returns the current DBIx::Connector connection handle.

    $self->dbh
        Returns the current database handle.

    $self->connect
        Connects to the database and returns the handle.
